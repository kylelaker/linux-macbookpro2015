# Linux on MacBook Pro 2015

This is what I use to make Linux more pleasant on a MacBook Pro 2015 (12,1).
The kernel config especially is suited specifically for my use case and may not
have enough options enabled for others.

Eventually this will be expanded with other configs and scripts.

## Kernel configs

Configs will be named `config-$(uname -r)`.
